Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that achieves and surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy on the Infrared Solar Modules dataset. We proposed an architecture that combines the strengths and principles of well-known architectures such as Unet, DenseNet, and HRnet. We will now refer to this architecture as HDUnet.
